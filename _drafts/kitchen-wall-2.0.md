According to App Store history, Kitchen Wall v1 officially launched to the public on April 16th 2017. Now, about a year and a half later, we are releasing Kitchen Wall v2 to the world! We couldn‚Äôt be happier for this app to make it to v2 because it marks a major milestone where we feel the core of the app is solid.

We‚Äôve heard from many of you that Kitchen Wall is working well for you too. Patrick and I have probably talked to hundreds of people through support emails and the feedback has been consistent. The app is simple to use, doesn‚Äôt put a bunch of bells and whistles in the way of managing lists, and it has a unique and friendly design that sets it apart from other apps.

I can tell you that we obsess over every new feature because we never want to over complicate the experience by introducing new features and functionality that don‚Äôt really belong. It‚Äôs a super fine line we are walking but all signs point to us being on the correct side of it.

## ü§î What can you expect for 2.0?

I‚Äôm glad you asked! We have a major new announcement to make that will give you a taste of the kind of innovations we have in store for the next year and beyond.

For a long time we have been adding emoji to our list titles to add a bit of extra flare and personalization. Apple has been investing a lot into emoji and with each release of iOS they have been refining and adding new emoji. We found it was a simple way to add color, imagery, and expressiveness to our lists.

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/1*6lVMoFdsGv1DXgq_vLII7w.jpeg =2048x1098)We started adding 1 emoji in the list title and now we can‚Äôt have a list without one.

Patrick showed me an early design experiment he had been working on for fun in his spare time (because that is what he likes to do, and we all love Patrick!). He took a bunch of emoji, organized them into themes, and positioned them on top of the list to create a more artistic looking list. The result was impressive and it was immediately obvious to us that this is what we had been looking for to take Kitchen Wall from ‚Äúa simple list app‚Äù to something truly unique and remarkable.

We call them **Artmoji** and we plan to light up the sky ‚ú® with them in 2019!

With Artmoji you can personalize your lists and create something delightful to look at. Just in time for the holiday season we‚Äôve added holiday themed Artmoji‚Äôs too. In fact, we are including 15 Artmoji in our 2.0 launch covering the most popular lists. We have plans to periodically release more and as always, we‚Äôll prioritize our work based on the feedback we get.
